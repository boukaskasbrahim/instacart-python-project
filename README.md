# Instacart Market Basket Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of CareerFoundry’s Data Analytics Program (Achievement 4).  
The goal was to analyze the [Instacart dataset](https://www.instacart.com/datasets/grocery-shopping-2017) to understand customer behavior and generate actionable insights for marketing and sales teams.  

I used Python for data wrangling, consistency checks, exploratory data analysis, and customer profiling.  

## 🗂️ Repository Structure
- **data_prepared/** → Cleaned and wrangled CSV files (not uploaded due to size/privacy).  
- **scripts/** → Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step analysis:
  - `4.1_data_imports.ipynb`
  - `4.2_data_cleaning.ipynb`
  - `4.3_customer_segmentation.ipynb`
  - `4.4_visualizations.ipynb`
- **outputs/** → Charts and tables generated during analysis.  
- **reports/** → Final report summarizing results with visuals.  

## 🛠️ Tools & Skills
- **Python:** pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Excel** (for quick checks and reporting)  

## 🔍 Key Steps in Analysis
1. **Data Wrangling & Cleaning**  
   - Merged multiple CSVs (orders, products, customers).  
   - Handled missing values, duplicates, and consistency checks.  

2. **Exploratory Analysis**  
   - Identified top-selling products and departments.  
   - Analyzed order frequency and basket sizes.  
   - Segmented customers by loyalty and spending habits.  

3. **Visualizations**  
   - Bar charts of most popular products.  
   - Heatmaps of order frequency by time of day and day of week.  
   - Pie charts for product category shares.  

## 📊 Key Insights
- Top departments: **produce** and **dairy eggs**.  
- Most orders occur on **Sundays and Mondays**.  
- Heavy shoppers are more likely to reorder the same products.  
- Opportunity: Create **targeted marketing campaigns** for loyal vs. new customers.
